# pyc_coglib
A clean, modular library of Pycord cogs that add custom commands and extra functionality to your Discord bots. Built to be plug-and-play, fully open-source, and easy to extend. Includes optional, standalone cogs like a ticket system, plus built-in utilities for logging and settings, and an example integration file to speed up setup.
